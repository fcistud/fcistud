# Mariam Hassan

AI Researcher | DeepMind Scholar | Foundation Models, Multimodal AI, and AI for Science

## About
AI researcher and DeepMind Scholar with experience in foundation models, LLMs, and multimodal learning. Completed an MSc in Artificial Intelligence for Biomedicine and Healthcare at UCL with Distinction. I build and adapt generative and multimodal model architectures for large, complex biomedical data and optimize LLM components for real-world scientific and healthcare applications.

## What I'm Building
- Biologically-Constrained Spatial Transcriptomics Framework: Developed a biologically-constrained LUPI framework with multi-objective optimization and strong biological validation for H&E-to-transcriptomics generation.
- Low-Resource Tokenization Benchmarking: Built embedding-aware tokenization extensions and benchmarking pipelines for morphologically complex languages, reducing Arabic OOV rates by 17.4%.
- Dynamic Vehicle Routing Research System: Developed a hybrid fuzzy receding horizon and genetic algorithm approach for dynamic assignment and routing under real-time uncertainty.
